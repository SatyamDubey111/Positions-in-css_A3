     - Ans of task 2 -

1. Absolute positioning->
A.With absolute positioning, an elment is positioned relative to it's nearest positioned ancestor(an ancestoe element is not static, i.e., has a position value of relative , absolute or fixed )
B.If no positioned anecsot is found,the element is positioned relaive to the initial containing block(usullay the viewport).
C. Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal document flow, meaning they dont affect the layout of other elements.
D.The element will leave the space as it original position and other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.

Example->

    .absolute {
   position: absolute;
   top: 50px;
   left: 100px;
}

2. Relative positioning-> 
A.With relative positioning, an element is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow.
B. When we apply relative positioning to an element (position:relative;),you can then use properties like top, right, bottom, left to move the element from its original position.
C.Other element on the page will still respect the space occupied by the relatively positioned element in the document flow.
D. The element will not leave any space in its original position.

Example-> 

  .relative {
   position: relative;
   top: 20px;
   left: 30px;
}
